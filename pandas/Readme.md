# Pandas Mastery Course

## 1. Course Overview
Welcome to the **Pandas Mastery Course**, designed to help intermediate Python developers advance their **data manipulation and analysis** skills using the Pandas library. Through **hands-on exercises** and **real-world scenarios**, you will learn to handle complex datasets, optimize performance, and create meaningful analyses and visualizations.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Intermediate-level Python knowledge (functions, classes, modules)
- Basic understanding of **data management** (CSV files, SQL basics, etc.)
- Familiarity with **fundamental Pandas** operations (e.g., DataFrames, indexing, simple groupby)

## 3. Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Perform **advanced data manipulation** (joins, merges, reshapes, pivoting).
2. Optimize performance when working with **large datasets**.
3. Conduct **statistical analysis** and apply advanced transformations.
4. Handle **time series data** effectively for financial or other time-based analyses.
5. Create **advanced visualizations** and reporting dashboards using Pandas.

## 4. Course Structure Overview
This course is split into **5 modules**, each containing **10 exercises** that gradually increase in difficulty.

- **[Module 1: Advanced Data Manipulation and Transformation](./Module1-AdvancedDataManipulation/README.md)**
  - Deep dive into reshaping data, merging, concatenation, pivot tables, and complex data transformations.
  
- **[Module 2: Performance Optimization and Large Dataset Handling](./Module2-PerformanceOptimization/README.md)**
  - Learn techniques for working with big data, including chunking, vectorization, and memory optimization.
  
- **[Module 3: Advanced Data Analysis and Statistical Operations](./Module3-AdvancedDataAnalysis/README.md)**
  - Focus on aggregations, statistical methods, groupby operations, and advanced numerical computations.
  
- **[Module 4: Time Series Analysis and Financial Applications](./Module4-TimeSeriesAnalysis/README.md)**
  - Work with date/time indices, resampling, rolling windows, forecasting, and financial data scenarios.
  
- **[Module 5: Advanced Visualization and Reporting with Pandas](./Module5-AdvancedVisualization/README.md)**
  - Harness Pandasâ€™ plotting capabilities, integrate with libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn, and build compelling reports.

## 5. Installation and Setup Instructions
1. **Install Python 3.11+** (if not already available).
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
# Additional packages as needed
